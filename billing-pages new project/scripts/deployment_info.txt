I've created three comprehensive deployment scripts:

deploy.sh: The main deployment script that:
Creates backups before deployment
Installs system dependencies
Configures Apache, MySQL, and PHP
Sets up security measures
Deploys the application
Configures SSL
Handles error cases and provides detailed logging

pre_deploy_check.sh: A pre-deployment verification script that:
Checks system requirements
Verifies PHP extensions
Validates file permissions
Tests database connection
Checks SSL certificate
Provides warnings and errors for potential issues

post_deploy_verify.sh: A post-deployment verification script that:
Verifies web server functionality
Checks database connectivity and tables
Validates file permissions
Tests application functionality
Verifies security measures
Checks monitoring setup

To use these scripts:
First, update the configuration variables in deploy.sh:
Apply to tour_edit.ph...
Run
Run the deployment process:
Apply to tour_edit.ph...
Run

The scripts include:
Error handling and logging
Color-coded output for better visibility
Backup creation before deployment
Security checks and configurations
Automatic SSL setup
Monitoring configuration
File permission management
Database setup and verification
