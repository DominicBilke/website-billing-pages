## General Information

### SSL or TLS Encryption

When you enter your data on websites, place online orders or send e-mails via the Internet, you must always be prepared for unauthorized third parties to access your data. There is no complete protection against such access. However, we do our utmost to protect your data as best we can and to close security gaps as far as we can.

An important protection mechanism is the SSL or TLS encryption of our website, which ensures that data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize the encryption by the lock icon in front of the Internet address entered in your browser and by the fact that our Internet address begins with https:// and not with http://.

### Encrypted Payment Transactions

Payment data, such as account or credit card numbers, require special protection. For this reason, payment transactions made with the most common means of payment are carried out exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection.

### How Long Do We Store Your Data?

In some parts in this privacy policy, we inform you about how long we or the companies that process your data on our behalf will store your data. In the absence of such information, we store your data until the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, you object to the data processing or you revoke your consent to the data processing.

In the event of an objection or revocation, we may however continue to process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:

- We have compelling legitimate grounds for continuing to process the data that override your interests, rights and freedoms (only applies in the case of an objection to data processing; if the objection is to direct marketing, we cannot provide legitimate grounds).
- The data processing is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims (does not apply if your objection is directed against direct advertising).
- We are required by law to retain your data.

In this case, we will delete your data as soon as the requirement(s) cease to apply.

### Data Transfer to the USA

On our website, we use tools from companies that transfer your data to the USA and store it there and, if necessary, process it further. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision for the EU-US data protection framework. The decision establishes that the US ensures an adequate level of protection for EU personal data transferred to US companies. This decision is based on new safeguards and measures put in place by the US to meet data protection requirements.

A list of all certified companies can be found at the following link: [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search).

## Your Rights

### Objection to Data Processing

IF IT'S STATED IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA AND THAT THIS PROCESSING IS THEREFORE BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 SENTENCE 1 LIT. F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ART. 21 GDPR. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING THAT IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PROVISION. THE PREREQUISITE IS THAT YOU STATE REASONS FOR THE OBJECTION THAT ARISE FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. NO REASONS ARE REQUIRED IF THE OBJECTION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE USE OF YOUR DATA FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING.

THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE OBJECTION IS THAT WE MAY NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR DATA. THIS ONLY DOES NOT APPLY IF ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PREREQUISITS EXISTS:

- WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.
- THE PROCESSING IS NECESSARY FOR ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS.

THESE EXCEPTIONS DO NOT APPLY IF YOUR OBJECTION IS DIRECTED AGAINST THE USE OF YOUR DATA FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING OR TO PROFILING RELATED TO IT.

### Other Rights

#### Withdrawal of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are based on your consent. You can give this consent, for example, by ticking the appropriate box on online forms before you send the form, or by allowing the operation of certain cookies when you visit our website. You may revoke your consent at any time without giving reasons (Art. 7 (3) GDPR). From the time of revocation, we may then no longer process your data. The only exception: we are required by law to retain the data for a certain period of time. Such retention periods exist in particular in tax and commercial law.

#### Right to Complain to the Competent Supervisory Authority

If you believe that we are in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 77 GDPR. You may contact a supervisory authority in the Member State of your residence, place of work or the place where the alleged infringement took place. The right to complain exists alongside administrative or judicial remedies.

#### Right to Data Portability

We must hand over data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract to you or a third party in a common machine-readable format if you request this. We can only transfer the data to another "data controller" if this is technically possible.

#### Right to Information, Deletion, and Correction of Data

According to Art. 15 GDPR, you have the right to receive information free of charge about which of your personal data we have stored, where the data came from, to whom we transmit the data and for what purpose it is stored. If the data is incorrect, you have a right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR), and under the conditions of Art. 17 GDPR you may demand that we delete the data.

#### Right to Restriction of Processing

In certain situations, according to Art. 18 GDPR, you may demand that we restrict the processing of your data. The data may then - apart from storage - only be processed as follows:

- with your consent
- for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims
- to protect the rights of another natural or legal person
- for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

## Data Processing on Our Website

### Server Log Files

The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:

- Browser type and browser version
- Operating system used
- Referrer URL
- Host name of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request
- IP address

This data is not merged with other data sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

### Contact Form

If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested.

The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

### Registration on This Website

You can register on our website in order to use additional functions on the site. We use the data entered for this purpose only for the purpose of using the respective offer or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject the registration.

For important changes, such as the scope of the offer or for technically necessary changes, we will use the e-mail address provided during registration to inform you in this way.

The processing of the data entered during registration is based on your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal communication by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.

The data collected during registration will be stored by us as long as you are registered on our website and will then be deleted. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.

### Processing of Data (Customer and Contract Data)

We collect, process and use personal data only insofar as they are necessary for the establishment, content or modification of the legal relationship (inventory data). This is done on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures. We collect, process and use personal data about the use of our Internet pages (usage data) only insofar as this is necessary to enable the user to use the service or to bill the user.

The collected customer data will be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Legal retention periods remain unaffected.

## Data Transmission at Contract Conclusion for Online Shops, Dealers and Goods Dispatch

We transmit personal data to third parties only if this is necessary in the context of contract processing, for example to the companies entrusted with the delivery of the goods or the credit institution entrusted with the processing of payments. A further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you have expressly agreed to the transmission. Your data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent, for example for advertising purposes.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.

## Data Transmission at Contract Conclusion for Services and Digital Content

We transmit personal data to third parties only if this is necessary in the context of contract processing, for example to the credit institution entrusted with the processing of payments.

A further transmission of the data does not take place or only if you have expressly agreed to the transmission. Your data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent, for example for advertising purposes.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR, which permits the processing of data for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures.
