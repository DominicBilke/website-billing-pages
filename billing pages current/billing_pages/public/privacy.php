            <h2>3. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h2>
            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
            <p>We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

            <h3>Note on the Responsible Entity</h3>
            <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>Dominic Bilke<br>
            Bilke Web- und Softwareentwicklung<br>
            Hanauer Landstrasse 291 B<br>
            60314 Frankfurt am Main<br>
            Germany</p>
            <p>Phone: +49 174 849 3008<br>
            Email: info@dominic-bilke.de</p>
            <p>The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons have ceased to exist.</p>

            <h3>General Notes on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if they are required to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. The data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Note on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</h3>
            <p>We use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these third countries. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It cannot therefore be ruled out that US authorities (e.g., secret services) process, evaluate, and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>

            <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

            <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED, UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE of DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>

            <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible person, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>

            <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
            <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>Encrypted Payment Transactions on This Website</h3>
            <p>If there is an obligation to provide us with your payment data (e.g., account number for direct debit authorization) after the conclusion of a paid contract, this data is required for payment processing.</p>
            <p>Payment transactions via the common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are made exclusively via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
            <p>With encrypted communication, your payment data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h3>Information, Deletion, and Correction</h3>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint if you have further questions on the subject of personal data.</p>

            <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our website uses cookies. These are small text files that your web browser stores on your terminal device. Cookies help us to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure.</p>
            <p>Some cookies are "session cookies." Such cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your browser session. On the other hand, other cookies remain on your terminal device until you delete them yourself. Such cookies help us to recognize you when you return to our website.</p>
            <p>With a modern web browser, you can monitor, restrict, or prevent the setting of cookies. Many web browsers can be configured to automatically delete cookies when the program is closed. The deactivation of cookies may result in limited functionality of our website.</p>
            <p>The setting of cookies, which are necessary for the exercise of electronic communication processes or the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g., shopping cart), is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically error-free and smooth provision of our services. If other cookies (e.g., for analysis functions) are set, these are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
            <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>

            <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website - for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

            <h3>Contact Form</h3>
            <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your information from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions.

            <p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed).

            <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
            <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
